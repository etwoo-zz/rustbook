type declaration for array

    let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
                 ^ number of elements
            ^^^
            type of each element

statements (do not return value) vs expressions (evaluate to resulting value)

    fn main() {
        let x = 5;

        let y = {
            let x = 3;
            x + 1
        };

        println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
    }

    This expression:

    {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    }

    is a block that, in this case, evaluates to 4. That value gets bound
    to y as part of the let statement. Note the x + 1 line without a
    semicolon at the end, which is unlike most of the lines you've seen
    so far. Expressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a
    semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement,
    which will then not return a value.

control flow: more expression usage

    Because `if` is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a
    `let` statement [...]

    fn main() {
        let condition = true;
        let number = if condition {
            5
        } else {
            6
        };

        println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
    }

    The number variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of
    the `if` expression.

    [...] you can add the value you want returned after the `break`
    expression you use to stop the loop; that value will be returned
    out of the loop so you can use it, as shown here:

    fn main() {
        let mut counter = 0;

        let result = loop {
            counter += 1;

            if counter == 10 {
                break counter * 2;
            }
        };

        println!("The result is {}", result);
    }

struct update syntax, like a refined copy constructor syntax

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
        active: user1.active,
        sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
    };

    Using struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less
    code [...] The syntax `..` specifies that the remaining fields not
    explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given
    instance.

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
        ..user1
    };

enum, like a sum type

    enum Message {
        Quit,
        Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
        Write(String),
        ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
    }

    This enum has four variants with different types:

        Quit has no data associated with it at all.
        Move includes an anonymous struct inside it.
        Write includes a single `String`.
        ChangeColor includes three `i32` values.

    Defining an enum with variants [...] is similar to defining
    different kinds of struct definitions, except the enum doesn't use
    the struct keyword and all the variants are grouped together under
    the Message type. The following structs could hold the same data
    that the preceding enum variants hold:

    struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
    struct MoveMessage {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,
    }
    struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
    struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct

    But if we used the different structs, which each have their own
    type, we couldn't as easily define a function to take any of these
    kinds of messages as we could with the Message enum [...], which is
    a single type.

if let; wtf? do people really use this language feature a lot?

    let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
    match some_u8_value {
        Some(3) => println!("three"),
        _ => (),
    }

    We want to do something with the `Some(3)` match but do nothing with
    any other `Some<u8>` value or the `None` value. To satisfy the
    `match` expression, we have to add `_ => ()` after processing just
    one variant, which is a lot of boilerplate code to add.

    Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using `if let` [...]

    if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
        println!("three");
    }

found clarification for `if let` on github issue for this book chapter

    https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues/1401#issuecomment-450628967

    You'd better think about `if let` as a one-handed `match` with no
    exhaustive checking enforced. In the case of the given example, it
    has nothing to do with `if` or `let`, that's why it is so confusing

    Maybe it would be better to rename the whole operator, call it
    `match once` or something like that.
